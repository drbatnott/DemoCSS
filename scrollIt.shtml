<h1>Sparkle the Penguin wizard</h1>
<p class="right">Once upon a time there was a penguin wizard. He was a very happy penguin.<br />
He could turn anything into fish just by pointing his wand at it and<br/>
declaring it to be fish.<br/>
The other penguins were often jealous of sparkle so the tried to eject<br>
him from the island where they lived. However, they were very scared<br />
of upsetting him. He might turn them into a fish.<br/>
One night when Sparkle was sleeping a group of the other penguins<br>
set off for the other side of the island. They knew that there were<br>
men living there who had large boats. they used for fishing. <br/>
They negotiated with the men to come and capture Sparkle as they<br/>
said he could work for them,turning things into fish and in return<br>
Sparkle would be able to try other sorts of things.<br/>
The men were doubtful. They had never met talking penguins before<br/>
and besides they worried that the penguins would take over the fishing<br/>
grounds and what if Sparkle did not want to work with them? </p>
<p>I really don't have the time or inspiration to write much more so I will<br>
increase the text size or just repeat the text above so that I have enough<br/>
text to demonstrate what I need to show.
